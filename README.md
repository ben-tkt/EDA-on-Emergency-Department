## ðŸŽ¯ My Objectives
* To share my work
* Receive feedback on improving my methods
* Serve as reference material for anyone trying to learn how to utilize SQL for EDA.

## ðŸ““ Project Description 
* **Objective** - To analyze data from the hospital's Emergency Department, report findings and suggest improvements 
* **Problem Statement** - Imagine myself as a manager in the hospital's Emergency Response Department. Analyze the data and answer the following questions:

  * Are our staffs lacking in any competency that we can work on
  * Is the safety of our patients fair and accounted for
  * When are the peak periods through the year/week/day

* **Data Source** - Can be found in repository or from  [Real World Fake Data ](https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Hospital+ER.csv).
